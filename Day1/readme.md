**Coding Practice Day 1/30**

Hi All,
Just starting with series of coding questions, feel free to prefer your programming language to solve the same.

Write a function which takes a number as input & sum its digit to return a single digit.

sumDigits(123) = 6   
//Explanation: 1+2+3=6

sumDigits(916) = 7
//Explanation: 9+1+6=16 => 1+6=7

sumDigits(19)  = 1   
//Explanation: 1+9=10 => 1+0=1
