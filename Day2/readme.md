**Coding Practice Day 2/30**

Hi All,
Continuing on the journey with series of coding questions, here is the next one.
Feel free to prefer your programming language to solve the same.

Write a function which takes a string as input and returns true if it contains all the numbers from 0 to 9.

containsAllNumbers("a78b9c01cd3e4526fk") = true 
//Explanation: Has all the numbers 0 to 9

containsAllNumbers("abcd1") = false
//Explanation: Is not having all the numbers from 0 to 9

containsAllNumbers("123456789") = false   
//Explanation: 0 is missing
